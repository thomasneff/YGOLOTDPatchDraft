AI-DECKS: 
CHECK if we can extend the number of AI decks in draft play -> just adding more decks doesn't crash, but doesn't add them either. Can't seem to expand that either.

I don't know what the first 8 bytes of the .ydc files is - seems to have a few fixed values (8C 64, 0A 61, ...)


NOTES:
Decks can be illegal (all Exodia pieces + only pot of greed left)
Fixed Padding/File sizes in Relinquished/Cyclone. 

SAVE NOTES:
Definitely contains some checksum. Don't want to bother with that atm, but I don't need write access anyway. I only need read to read out the drafted deck again :)

Battle Pack save data:
22 bytes after "Battle Pack: Epic Dawn":
  2 bytes main-deck number of cards (== numBytes / 2)
  2 bytes extra-deck size (== numBytes / 2)
  2 bytes side-deck size (== numBytes / 2)
then:
  60 cards main-deck (0x0000 if no card) -> 120 bytes
  15 cards extra-deck (0x0000 if no card) -> 30 bytes
  15 cards side-deck (0x0000 if no card) -> 30 bytes
  
then afterwards: some junk, and then: cards you drafted


PACK NOTES:
Apparently they do rarity by simply adding multiples of cards?. 
Extracting the .ydc works the same as extracting the .bin files, so the fixed Cyclone/Relinquished works for both decks and packs.

Increasing the size by just adding cards -> everything breaks.

The battlepack has 5 card categories -> categories are related to the draft: for each category, 3 cards are drawn. (5 x 3 cards = 15)

<= 4 Categories: Works, but breaks because we need enough cards which we cannot get then.
>= 6 Categories: Makes the game crash


PACK HEADER:
8 bytes "num" -> number of "categories" or offsets
"num" x 8 bytes -> offsets leading to start of categories
"num" blocks:
  2 byte length -> number of cards in that block. (== numBytes / 2)
  length x 2 byte cards -> card IDs (same as used on the official yugioh database)
  
You can extend those files past their initial size without issues. 


about cards that are not available -> can extract them from card names bin files...

need to use a different API for scraping the card_map.csv now. Should modify the script to only re-scrape the things that are either 65535 or simply not there
